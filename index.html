<h3>The 2nd Best Sequel of All Time <small>1/20/2019</small></h3>

<p>Shrek 2 determined to be the second greatest sequel of all time. Even former UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, agrees. After the first movie knocked it out of the park, both artistically and commercially, none can deny this serves as a worthy sequel.</p>

<h3>Abraham Lincoln is Alive and Really Angry <small>1/05/2019</small></h3>

<p>After several reported sightings, I have come to believe that former American President Abraham Lincoln in fact is alive and faked his death after getting sick of being in such a stressful office. He then proceeded to become a vampire and to this day roams the lands hunting other vampires, like Blade.</p>

<p>I'm actually being dead serious. My roomate and I randomly decided to see it when it was in theatres last holiday season despite not having seen the first one and enjoyed it far more than we could have possibly expected. If you haven't seen it give it a try.</p>

<h3>Who Cares About the Royals? <small>12/04/2018</small></h3>

<p>The British Royal Family is honestly super overrated. I mean, even as far as royal families go. First off, they are not even English they were originally a German dynasty that changed their name to Windsors because of World War I. The Japanese royal family is about a thousand times cooler since not only is it actually Japanese in origin, but also it's existed longer than any other known dynasty, having ruled Japan for millenia.</p>
